      “ I guarantee you a better future, one where freedom is common and people
      have no laws to follow. This is what I can do and if you vote for me this
      will be true.” People had been voting the whole day until the top 2 most
      voted people for president were selected. One promised to provide
      limitless smartphone entertainment, while the other nominee promised the
      people that every grey wolf in Europe and the middle east would be
      returned to turkey. Europe Same time, same day “ He hadn’t been elected
      yet but he was so sure that his competition would be easy, so he made us
      28 grad school scientists explore the rest of Europe and he told us
      clearly, place a homing device and GPS tracker on every grey wolf in the
      continent if you want to be paid. Middle East Same time same day President
      to be Turkiye Demir has conducted us 17 grad school scientists toward the
      middle east `with the instructions, 1 person goes to 1 country and each
      person is to put a homing device and tracker on every grey wolf in that
      country. He gave us a country and the number of wolves in each, so we do
      as he told us to. Iran- Turkey border 11:49 Pm Population 200 The Midnight
      shift was usually a time when Iran and Turkey’s borders were quiet and
      that’s why only the laziest guards were on duty. They snoozed around
      harmlessly while placing their rifles on top of the bamboo wall, unaware
      of the horrible disaster about to befall their country, A mistake so
      costly that history books, Newspapers, and political debates would rage
      about them. Iran- Turkey border 12:07 pm Population 200 The wolves had
      been watching the border from a safe distance for nearly 12 hours and when
      their time came they stealthy made their move to slide through the barbed
      wires quietly, knowing that a tiny misstep would wake up the lazy guards.
      I couldn’t find food only humans our chances of survival were Critical and
      now in the hands of brave humans, until I heard my Cousin Ali say “why to
      rely on humans to give food when they are food” I knew Ali well, when he
      says or asks something he does the questions nasty answer or whatever his
      mind tells him which is mostly bad. I wondered why my ancestors truly
      loved this place, I was cold in the night but hot in the day just like
      every other place.2 Days later Mount Suphan Population 100 The mountain we
      reached was lovely just the way the pack and I liked it. The snow was
      blistering cold, The trees were high and beautiful, The river was filled
      for miles and miles, and finally, there were lots of food supply. 3
      newborn pups had died of hunger in the last 2 Days, Ali couldn’t walk and
      my wife Athar was alone in this unknown place searching for food. A few
      hours later my wife Athar came back and told me about this light red and
      blacked striped big cat consuming a horned sheep. I told her to bring the
      whole pack to this big cat. Once we reached I saw that it was alone just
      lying down under a tree, Ali Said he was the type of food we needed and
      for once I agreed. I pass this story to my wife Athar. The River 3 Hours
      Later Funeral X We were down at the river, the heat there burned my coat
      as I howled and howled and for once Ali did too. I ran out of breath and
      drank some water, this water was unusual, it tasted like the blood of my
      son at birth. I suddenly felt determined and angry, I ordered the wolves
      to drink the magical water. We left with speed and never came back. 1 Day
      Later Istanbul Population 14,968,000 Memories of my life as a pup rushed
      back, this place I used to call home in time humans called 11 years ago
      that time we and people lived without worries together. Now the human
      citizens treated us horribly, they gave us no meat, we weren’t even
      slightly noticed or embraced, they treated us as if we were garbage or
      pure filth. That night Ali howled the chant.......
